// Package rootfs extracts all layers of a Docker container image to a single
// tarball. It will go trough all layers in order and copy every file to the
// destination archive.
//
// Except it will also reasonably process those files.
//
// == Non-directory will be copied only once ==
// A non-directory will be copied only once, only from within it's past
// occurrence. I.e. if file /a/b was found in layers 0 and 2, only the file
// from layer 2 will be used.
// Directories will always be copied, even if there are duplicates. This is
// to avoid a situation like this:
//   layer0:
//   - ./dir/
//   - ./dir/file
//   layer1:
//   - ./dir/
//   - ./dir/file
// In theory, the directory from layer 1 takes precedence, so a tarball like
// this could be created:
// - ./dir/      (from layer1)
// - ./dir/file1 (from layer1)
// However, imagine the following:
//   layer0:
//   - ./dir/
//   - ./dir/file1
//   layer1:
//   - ./dir/
// Then the resulting tarball would have:
// - ./dir/file1 (from layer1)
// - ./dir/      (from layer0)
// Which would mean `untar` would try to untar a file to a directory which
// was not yet created. Therefore directories will be copied to the resulting
// tar in the order they appear in the layers.
//
// == Special files: .dockerenv ==
//
// .dockernv is present in all docker containers, and is likely to remain
// such. So if you do `docker export <container>`, the resulting tarball will
// have this file. rootfs will not add it. You are welcome to append one
// yourself.
//
// == Special files: opaque files and dirs (.wh.*) ==
//
// From mount.aufs(8)[1]:
//
// The whiteout is for hiding files on lower branches. Also it is applied to
// stop readdir going lower branches. The latter case is called ‘opaque
// directory.’ Any whiteout is an empty file, it means whiteout is just an
// mark. In the case of hiding lower files, the name of whiteout is
// ‘.wh.<filename>.’ And in the case of stopping readdir, the name is
// ‘.wh..wh..opq’. All whiteouts are hardlinked, including ‘<writable branch
// top dir>/.wh..wh.aufs`.
//
// My interpretation:
// - a hardlink called `.wh..wh..opq` means that directory contents from the
// layers below the mentioned file should be ignored. Higher layers may add
// files on top.
// - if hardlink `.wh.([^/]+)` is found, $1 should be deleted from the current
// and lower layers.
//
// == Tar format ==
//
// Since we do care about long filenames and large file sizes (>8GB), we are
// using "classic" GNU Tar. However, at least NetBSD pax is known to have
// problems reading it[2].
